# Phonepad

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.3.

## Requirement

1.  The application should accept and validate a 7 or 10 digit phone number.

2.  Assuming a standard alpha-numeric telephone keypad generates a list of all possible combinations of alpha-numeric phone numbers from the input phone number. Display the total count at the beginning.

3.  Implemented paging for the output with each page getting it's data from a mock-server.

4.  Provided unit tests for the implementation.

# Run application

Run `npm run start:mock` for the dev server along with mock server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
